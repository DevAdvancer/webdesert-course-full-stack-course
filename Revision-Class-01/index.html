        I'm a fresher security operations analyst and full-stack developer with a passion for competitive programming. My journey began with a fascination for both cybersecurity and algorithm optimization, leading me to develop a unique skill set that bridges defense and development.
        With hands-on experience in security monitoring, incident response, and threat hunting, I also bring strong development capabilities in modern web technologies and data structures. My competitive programming background has honed my ability to write efficient, optimized code.
        I'm seeking opportunities where I can leverage both my security operations and development expertise to build secure, scalable applications while continuing to grow professionally.
